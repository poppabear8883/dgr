                    Our shingle of choice when it comes to composition asphalt shingles, is Certainteed, as their
                    shingle is high quality. It has the industry's toughest fiber glass mat, the strongest material
                    available and the best warranty. The Landmark Series shingle endure time and weather
                    beautifully. They come with the exclusive StreakFighter warranty, protecting your roof from
                    streaking that can be caused by airborne algae. The Landmark Series also has four levels of
                    high performance shingles in weight and thickness. The heavier the shingle, the more depth,
                    thickness and dimension it offers.
